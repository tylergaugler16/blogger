It began when his dad, a shrimper, would wake him up at 3:30 a.m. to go to the fish house. Castillo didn’t have much of a choice in the matter, and he didn’t try to avoid the early morning assignment. \r\nCastillo doesn’t know what it’s like not to get to work before sunrise.\r\n\r\nFrom an early age, Castillo learned what having a strong work ethic entails. It began when his dad, a shrimper, would wake him up at 3:30 a.m. to go to the fish house. Castillo didn’t have much of a choice in the matter, and he didn’t try to avoid the early morning assignment. \r\n\r\n“You don’t really ask, you just do,” he said.\r\n\r\nCastillo doesn’t just carry this attitude on the football field; it has become his motto in all aspects of his life.\r\n\r\nBoth of his parents came to the United States from Mexico at the ages of 13 and 14 and went straight to work.\r\n\r\nWhile most kids enter the sixth grade with teenage excitement, Castillo realized that he would need to become an adult quicker than most one morning in the summer of 1970.\r\n\r\nCastillo’s dad went to work and did not come home that night.  He fell off the shrimp boat, and drowned. With two younger sisters to take care of, Castillo became the man of the house at age 11.\r\n\r\nCastillo’s mother became the sole financial provider for the family. She worked two jobs, one as a maid and the other clearing dishes at a restaurant. \r\n\r\nCastillo credits his mother for two important values: his work ethic and teaching him the importance of treating people with respect.\r\n\r\n“She was always really nice to everybody,” he said.\r\n\r\nGrowing up in the small town of Port Isabel, Texas, kids start playing football in the streets from a young age. This is where Castillo was introduced to the game of football; the game that changed his life.\r\n\r\nCastillo attended Port Isabel High School where he played on the football team as a linebacker and tight end. He wasn’t the fastest, strongest, or most talented, but he developed a work ethic that pushed him to become the first person in his family to ever graduate high school.\r\n\r\nCastillo knew he wanted to play college football, but the only school that offered him a scholarship was Monterrey Tech in Monterrey, Mexico. Although not ideal, he saw it as an opportunity.\r\n\r\nHe became a starting linebacker, but after his freshman year, the school ended its football program. Castillo’s career at Monterrey Tech was over, but he was not ready to hang up the cleats just yet.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to Port Isabel, he reached out to his high school football coach, a former player at Texas A&M- Kingsville, named Fred Jonas, the head coach at Texas A&M-Kingsville. Jonas agreed to give Castillo a tryout.\r\n\r\n", "tag_list"=>"\"ravens, football\""}, "commit"=>"Update Article", "id"=>"11"}
